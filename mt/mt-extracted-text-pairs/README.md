Conventions

**`File Name`**

- files should be saved as `.txt` file
- file name should be numeric part of text id. eg: for text id `EN00001`, file name should be `00001.txt`
  
**`File Content`**

- file should only have only two line
- each line should have prefix of text id in any order

for example
```.txt
EN
BO
```

- text extraction for the text pair is completed when:
   - file contains two lines
   - file contains `EN` and `BO` strings.
